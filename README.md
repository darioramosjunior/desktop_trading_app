# desktop_trading_app
This project is desktop trading app for cryptocurrency trading where there are three tabs. 
The first tab is the Watchlist tab where the user can monitor & set alerts for specific coins & calculate position size as well.
The second one is the News tab where the user can check if there are important news releases for the day that can affect the market volatility, e.g., US CPI releases, etc.
The third tab is the Analytics tab where the user can upload an exported trade history from his/her crypto broker, & the app will generate performanc visualization like the win rate, average loss/gain & portfolio movemnet.
This project is still a work-in progress.
The complete one is the Watchlist tab.
I'm still working on the News tab & Analytics tab.
